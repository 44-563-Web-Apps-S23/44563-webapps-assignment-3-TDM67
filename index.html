 While developing, most of the Sass I interact with does not have comments, besides the occasional header. As a result, I have gotten in the habit of not commenting my Sass.
However, I often find it would be useful to have comments in Sass that I am working with. Should you comment Sass besides a header indicating an author? If so, how?
I am not asking the process of how to comment, but rather the best practice.
